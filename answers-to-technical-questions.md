Question 1: How long did you spend on the coding test?
Answer: I spent approximately 12 hours on the coding test.

Question 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
Answer: One of the most useful features added to the latest version of React is the introduction of React Hooks. Hooks allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features without writing a class. Below is an example of how I've used the useState hook in the task management application:

// Example using useState hook in TaskForm.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const TaskForm = () => {
  const [taskTitle, setTaskTitle] = useState('');
  const [taskDescription, setTaskDescription] = useState('');

  const handleTitleChange = (e) => {
    setTaskTitle(e.target.value);
  };

  const handleDescriptionChange = (e) => {
    setTaskDescription(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <form>
      <label>Title:</label>
      <input type="text" value={taskTitle} onChange={handleTitleChange} />

      <label>Description:</label>
      <textarea value={taskDescription} onChange={handleDescriptionChange} />
    </form>
  );
};

export default TaskForm;


Question 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Answer: To track down a performance issue in production, I would follow these steps:

Identify the Issue: Understand the specific performance problem reported or observed.
Collect Data: Use monitoring tools, logs, and performance profiling tools to collect relevant data, such as response times, resource usage, and error rates.
Isolate the Problem: Identify the components or services causing the performance degradation.
Analyze Code: Review the code related to the identified components, focusing on inefficient algorithms, resource-intensive operations, or bottlenecks.
Optimize Code: Implement optimizations, such as caching, lazy loading, or code refactoring, to address the performance issue.
Testing: Deploy the optimized code to a staging environment and conduct performance testing to validate improvements.
Monitor: Continuously monitor the application in production to ensure sustained performance improvements.
Yes, I have experience tracking down and resolving performance issues in production environments.


Question 4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
Answer: If I had more time, I would consider adding the following features and improvements:

User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to have personalized task lists.
Task Categories or Tags: Add the ability for users to categorize tasks with tags or categories for better organization.
Task Reminders: Implement reminders and notifications for upcoming tasks.
Task Sorting: Allow users to sort tasks based on different criteria, such as due date, priority, or completion status.
Enhanced Styling: Improve the overall user interface with more polished and responsive styling.
Accessibility Improvements: Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities by following best practices.
Unit Testing: Implement unit tests to ensure the robustness and reliability of the application.
